# Promote, Pitch, Or Present Your GitHub Projects

## What is GitPitch?

GitPitch is a service that turns **[PITCHME.md](https://gitpitch.com/#gitpitch-pitchme-markdown)** markdown into online, interactive slideshows. You can use it to promote, pitch or present anything, including your own GitHub projects.

Each slideshow presentation is made instantly available online just as soon as you git-commit and push **PITCHME.md** on any branch within a public GitHub repo.

## Is GitPitch for you?

If you ever find yourself needing to present a project, design, library, integration, framework, or solution:

- To colleagues, clients or customers
- Or at meetups or conferences

Then GitPitch is for you. Simply capture your ideas in Markdown and let GitPitch automatically turn those ideas into compelling, responsive, online slideshow presentations.

## How does GitPitch work?

No more Keynote. No more PowerPoint. Just Markdown. Then git-commit on any branch within a public GitHub repo.
