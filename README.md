## What Is GitPitch?

GitPitch is a service that turns **PITCHME.md** markdown into online, interactive slideshows. You can use it to promote, pitch or present your GitHub projects.

Each slideshow presentation is made instantly available online just as soon as you *git-commit* and *push* **PITCHME.md** on any branch within a public GitHub repo.
